Automobile Price EDA Project
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on an automobile price dataset to gain insights into various aspects of automobile pricing.

Tools & Libraries:
Python: Programming language used for data analysis.
Pandas Profiling: Python library used for automated exploratory data analysis & YData Profiling

Methodology
Data Collection: We start by collecting the automobile price dataset, which contains information about various attributes of automobiles and their corresponding prices.
Data Preparation: Before conducting the analysis, we clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We utilize Pandas Profiling, a powerful tool for automated exploratory data analysis, to analyze the dataset. 
Pandas Profiling generates a comprehensive report that includes summary statistics, data quality metrics, and visualizations to help us understand the dataset better.
Insights Generation: Based on the analysis conducted using Pandas Profiling, we derive insights into the automobile pricing dataset.
We identify patterns, trends, correlations, and potential issues that can provide valuable information for decision-making.
